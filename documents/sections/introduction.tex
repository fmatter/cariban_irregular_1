\input{floats/hixintro}
\input{floats/triintro}
Cariban languages feature relatively rich verbal morphology, both pre- and suffixes, inflecting for person, number, tense, aspect, and evidentiality, combined with a range of valency-modifying derivational markers.
A split-\gl{s} system can be reconstructed to \PC, discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:split}.
\cref{tab:hixintro} shows person paradigms for four \hixka verbs, members of the \gl{s_a_} inflectional class.%
\footnote{The presence of a \gl{1+2} person value implies that of a \gl{1+3} value.
This is usually expressed with a free pronoun combined with third person morphology in Cariban languages, so it is not represented as a distinct value in the paradigms we show.}%
\footnote{In \cref{tab:hixintro} and the remainder of this paper, we omit any TAM suffixes found in the original forms found in the literature, since a) our focus lies on the prefixes and stems, and b) full paradigms containing the same TAM suffix are rarely found.}%
\footnote{
We use standard IPA symbols in our transcription of Cariban languages, with the exception of coronal rhotics, which we simply represent with \ort{r}, rather than \ort{ɽ} for \wayana or \ort{ɾ̠} for \maqui etc.
In languages with strong morphophonological processes and/or subphonemic orthography we show the original transcription in an additional surface line when presented in an interlinearized glossed example.
We follow \textcite{gildea2018reconstructing} in using \ort{ə} for the proto-vowel reconstructed by \textcite{meira2005southern}, although it was likely more back \parencite{gildea2010story}.}
\footnote{Glossing abbreviations: }%\glossingAbbrevsComma.}
A comparison of these paradigms shows that the verb \qu{to be} diverges from the others in its first person marker.
That prefix is \obj{w-}, while other \gl{s_a_} verbs like \qu{to fall} have \obj{k(ɨ)-}.
A similar example can be found in \trio, where the verb \qu{to go} has a first-person prefix \obj{wɨ-} while other \gl{s_a_} verbs have a prefix with phonologically conditioned allomorphs \envr{\obj{t-}}{\obj{ə}} and \envr{\obj{s-}}{\obj{e}} \pcref{tab:triintro}.
In both languages, the verbs on the left of the table are representative for the \gl{s_a_} class, since the vast majority is inflected identically.
In both languages, there are only a few other verbs inflected identically to the divergent ones on the right; for example, the first-person form of \trio \qu{to be} is \obj{w-ei-} \parencites[339]{triomeira1999}.

In our synchronic analyses of these two languages, we consider these verbs and their first person prefixes \textsc{irregular}, contrasting with regular prefixes on regular \gl{s_a_} verbs, \obj{k(ɨ)-} and \obj{t-}/\obj{s-}.
However, there is no widely accepted definition of irregularity \parencite{stolz2012introduction}, and many stricter definitions \parencite[][e.g.]{haspelmath2010understanding} require the pattern to occur at a single place in the grammar.
For such approaches, these verbs simply belong to a small inflectional (sub-)class. %
%\footnote{That analysis is found in synchronic descriptions of other Cariban languages discussed in more detail later, see \textcites[149]{alves2017arara}[4]{meira2003bakairi}.}
Regardless of synchronic analysis, the explanation for these inflectional patterns lies, as so often, in diachrony.
Our story starts with the verbal person marking system of \PC, discussed in \cref{sec:pc_person}.
That system was subject to different kinds of innovations; the one responsible for the irregular \hixka and \trio verbs is introduced in \cref{sec:extensions_intro}.
A particular component of that system, the distinction between \gl{s_a_} and \gl{s_p_} verbs, played a major role in the developments under discussion and is the topic of \cref{sec:split}.

%\subsection{Cariban verbal person marking and marker extensions}
%\label{sec:background}
%The archaic first person markers investigated in this paper are the result of incomplete person marker extensions, i.e., modifications to the ancestral prefix system that did not affect the whole lexicon.
%To provide readers with the necessary background, we first introduce said ancestral system \pcref{sec:pc_person}, then the peculiarities of the Cariban split-\gl{s} system \pcref{sec:split}, and finally the concept of person marker extensions \pcref{sec:extensions_intro}.

\subsubsection{\PC verbal person marking}
\label{sec:pc_person}
\PC is reconstructed by \textcite{gildea1998} as using a person paradigm called \setone in its independent verb forms, shown in \cref{tab:pcpers}.
The choice of person marker in transitive verbs can be characterized as being conditioned by a basic person hierarchy \fbox{\gl{1}/\gl{2} > \gl{3}}.
The locuphoric markers had two forms, an \gl{a}-oriented one for direct (\gl{sap}>\gl{3}) scenarios and a \gl{p}-oriented one for inverse (\gl{3}>\gl{sap}) scenarios.
There was a single aliophoric marker \rc{n(i)-}, which only surfaced in nonlocal (\gl{3}>\gl{3}) scenarios, without morphologically expressed distinctions between different third person referents.
Local scenarios were expressed in a non-transparent manner, both using the \gl{1+2} prefix \rc{k-}.

\input{floats/pcpers}

Formally identical or etymologically related markers occured in intransitive verbs, which showed a split-\gl{s} system \pcref{tab:pcintrans}.
That is, \gl{s_a_} verbs took similar markers as the \gl{a}-oriented ones in transitive verbs, with the exception of first person (\gl{1}>\gl{3} \rc{t(i)-} vs \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} \rc{w-}), as well as the absence of \rc{i} after all \gl{s_a_} prefixes.
On the other hand, \gl{s_p_} verbs took markers fully identical to the \gl{p}-oriented ones.
The third person marker in \gl{s_p_} verbs was identical to the one in \gl{3}>\gl{3} scenarios (\rc{n(i)-)}.

Equipped with knowledge about the ancestral system, it becomes clear that the irregularly inflected \hixka and \trio  preserve the original \PC \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} prefix \rc{w-} and are therefore \textsc{conservative}.
They contrast with regular \gl{s_a_} verbs, which are innovative in both languages.
The reflexes of \rc{w-} may be considered \textsc{relics}, old and restricted to specific lexically conditioned contexts, contrasting with the innovative prefixes found elsewhere.
The verbs and their prefixes are comparable with the few English nouns like \obj{ox}, which preserve the old plural suffix \obj{-en}.
It, too, was once more widespread, being the normal plural suffix of the weak inflection, compare German \obj{Ochse-n} \qu{ox-en}, \obj{Name-n} \qu{name-s}, \obj{Hase-n} \qu{hare-s}, \obj{Bär-en} \qu{bear-s}.
Since the irregular \hixka and \trio prefixes are conservative and the regular prefixes are innovative, the next question to be addressed is where these new prefixes came from.


%\input{floats/makintro}

\subsubsection{Person marker extensions in intransitive verbs}
\label{sec:extensions_intro}
In his discussion of the \PC split-\gl{s} system and reconstruction of the intransitive person prefixes, \textcite[88--96]{gildea1998} shows that the system has undergone many different modifications in various languages.
The main mechanism of change leading to these modifications are \textbf{person marker extensions}, i.e. the use of verbal person prefixes being extended to contexts previously occupied by other prefixes.
%\footnote{
%In principle, one could also imagine a scenario in which verbs of one of the classes are gradually replaced with innovative verbs from the other class, as suggested for \panare by \textcite[225]{meira2000split}.
%However, the verbs Meira sampled came from the \emp{A}-section of \posscite{mattei1994diccionario} dictionary \perscommpar{Spike Gildea}, and \obj{at-}\slash{}\obj{at͡ʃ-}\slash{}\obj{as-} is a frequent reflex of \detrz in \panare, meaning that many \gl{s_a_} verbs are \obj{a}-initial, thus explaining the 80:40 \gl{s_a_}:\gl{s_p_} ratio in Meira's sample.
%Thus, the hypothesis that \panare has largely replaced \gl{s_p_} with \gl{s_a_} verbs remains to be thoroughly tested.
%For the moment, the most likely scenario leading to the eventual loss of the split-\gl{s} system involves markers being extended to new verbs.}
There have been many different person marker extensions in Cariban languages, and some are still ongoing.
This is illustrated by \textcite{gildea1998}, using the three Parukotoan languages as an example.
Apart from segmental changes to individual morphemes, the following innovations happened in the \setone paradigm in Parukotoan:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \PPar \begin{enumerate}
		\item \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} \rc{w-} to \gl{1}>\gl{3}
		\item \gl{1+2} \rc{k-} to \gl{1}\gl{s_p_} (completed in \PWai, ongoing in \kaxui)
		\item \gl{1+2} \rc{kɨt-} to \gl{1+2}\gl{s_p_} (completed in \PWai, ongoing in \kaxui)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \PWai \begin{enumerate}
		\item \gl{1}\gl{s_p_} \rc{k-} to \gl{1}\gl{s_a_}
		\item innovative \rc{owɨro j-} \qu{\gl{1}\gl{pro} \gl{lk}} for \gl{1}\gl{p}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \waiwai \begin{enumerate}
		\item \gl{2}\gl{s_a_} \obj{m-} to \gl{2}\gl{s_p_}\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
%
All innovations are person marker extensions except 2b, which combined a pronoun with the linker \rc{j-}.
They are printed in bold in \cref{fig:par_ext}, which reproduces \posscite{gildea1998} tables as a tree diagram, with adapted transcription and the additional alternative \kaxui \gl{1}\gl{s_p_} marker ∅/\obj{j-} \perscommpar{Spike Gildea}.

\end{figure}
%
\hixka has preserved split-\gl{s} only in the second person prefixes, while \kaxui still shows the variation in the first person and \gl{1+2} prefixes that is reconstructible to \PPar.
\waiwai, on the other hand, has lost the system entirely, which notably happened via distinct innovations at three different diachronic stages.
%In this case, the loss of the inflectional classes also entailed the loss of the other morphological traces of the split-\gl{s} system.
%That is, the \gl{s_a_} class marker \rc{w-} \pcref{sec:split} was lost in \waiwai, as evidenced by the contrast between the \waiwai and \kaxui deverbal forms in \exref{wailoss.wai-158} and \exref{wailoss.kax-138}.
%Similarly, the \gl{2}\gl{s_p_} prefix \obj{a-} was extended to imperatives of (former) \gl{s_a_} verbs \exref[wailoss.wai-112]{wailoss.hix-43}, but only C-initial ones \parencite[62]{waiwaihawkins1998}.


%Such extensions, often only affecting one person value at a time, and the eventual loss of split-\gl{s} are not entirely unexpected, given that the system lacks any semantic basis.

\textcite{gildea1998} discusses person marker extensions only in the context of the loss of the split-\gl{s} system and the accompanying changes to indexing alignment; for our story we will zoom in on a so far neglected aspect of these extensions.
To begin, we argue that they took place via lexical diffusion, a type of extension \parencite[106--115]{harris1995historical}; this hypothesis is supported by three facts.
First, the variation in first person and \gl{1+2} prefixes described above for \kaxui is not completely free.
Rather, some verbs only allow for example first person \obj{k-}, but not \obj{j-}, while others can occur with both, which is the expected pattern in a lexical diffusion scenario.
In addition, this is speaker-dependent \perscommpar{Spike Gildea}, which is what one would expect from a change in progress.
%todo maybe put in GOOD kaxui data
Second, while there is no detailed diachronic scenario for the switch of \gl{1}>\gl{3} \rc{t-} and \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} in the Tiriyoan languages \pcref{sec:taranoan}, \textcite[111--112]{meira1998proto} convincingly argues that it must have happened gradually rather than instantaneously, and entailed both markers spreading at the same time.
Whether this gradual switch was along ordered lines or not, lexical diffusion must have played a role.

Our third argument in favor of the lexical diffusion scenario brings us back to the \hixka and \trio verbs with conservative first person forms:
In both cases, the innovative \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} prefixes were introduced by a person marker extension spreading via lexical diffusion.
We interpret the continued presence of the old \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} marker in a few verbs as the extension stopping short of these verbs, rather than affecting all targets (\gl{s_a_} verbs).
In our investigations of person marker extensions, we identified 19 individual cases affecting intransitive verbs, and found 6 of them to be incomplete.
These incomplete extensions have left between 1 and 7 conservatively inflected verbs in 9 Cariban languages. %, marked with bold print in \cref{fig:caribantree}.
Interestingly, all six extensions featured innovative first person markers on \gl{s_a_} verbs.
While extensions occurred with other person values as well, they never affected \gl{s_a_} verbs, only \gl{s_p_} ones, and they always affected all potential targets.
Illustrative examples for complete extensions are shown in \cref{tab:completed}: the extension of \gl{1+2}\gl{s_a_} \obj{s(ɨ)-} (< \rc{kɨt-}) to \gl{s_p_} verbs in \apalai \pcref{tab:apalai}, of \gl{2}\gl{s_a_} \obj{m(ɨ)-} in to \gl{s_p_} verbs in \panare \pcref{tab:panare},\footnote{The presence of the third person marker \obj{n-} for \gl{1+2} is due to the wholesale loss of that inflectional value.} or the extension of the entire \gl{s_a_} set to \gl{s_p_} verbs in \waimiri \pcref{tab:waimiri}.%, as well as the extension of \rc{k-} to \gl{1}\gl{s_p_} and of \rc{tɨt-} to \gl{1+2}\gl{s_p_} in \PWai \pcref{fig:par_ext}.

The markedly different behavior of \gl{s_a_} and \gl{s_p_} verbs with regards to the extent of extensions affeting them points to the split-\gl{s} system playing some role, a suspicion which will be confirmed in \cref{sec:discussion}.
Thus, we will discuss that system in a little more detail before moving on to the incomplete extensions.
This will also give readers an idea how it is possible for the \gl{s_a_}/\gl{s_p_} distinction to be lost only for a single person, or for \gl{s_p_} verbs to take on \gl{s_a_} markers with apparent semantic impunity.

\input{floats/completed}

\subsubsection{The morphological basis of the split-\gl{s} system}
\label{sec:split}
As seen in \cref{sec:pc_person}, the \PC distinction between \gl{s_a_} and \gl{s_p_} verbs was implemented by two inflection classes within the \setone prerson paradigm, but this was not the only morphological criterion:
%\begin{inlinelist}
%	\item presence vs absence of the \gl{s_a_} marker \rc{w-}
%	\item absence vs presence of the second person prefix \rc{ə(j)-} in imperatives
%	\item presence vs absence of a derivational detransitivizing prefix
%\end{inlinelist}.
%
Many languages show an \gl{s_a_} class marker in deverbalized forms, which can be reconstructed to \PC as \rc{w-}.\footnote{See \textcite[227]{meira2000split}, who identifies reflexes of this morpheme as having \dbqu{no purpose other than being \qu{class markers}, without any obvious semantic or functional load}.}
With \gl{s_a_} verbs, \rc{w-} occurred immediately between the possessive prefixes and the verb stem, while \gl{s_p_} verbs took the bare prefixes.
Reflexes of \rc{w-} in languages from different branches are illustrated in \cref{tab:participles,tab:nominalizations} for participles and nominalizations.%
%
\input{floats/participles}%
%
\input{floats/nominalizations}%
%
The distinction between \gl{s_a_} and \gl{s_p_} was also borne out in imperatives.
Here, \gl{s_p_} verbs took the \gl{p}-oriented second person prefix \rc{ə(j)-}, while \gl{s_a_} verbs were unprefixed (both suffixed with \rc{-kə}).
This is illustrated with reflexes in various modern languages in \cref{tab:imperatives}.
Both the \gl{s_a_} marker \rc{w-} in participles and nominalizations and the prefixes in imperativees have been lost in some languages, but are reconstructible to \PC.
However, there was one further property uniting most \gl{s_a_} verbs, not based on inflectional morphology.

\input{floats/imperatives}

%\subsubsection{The detransitivizing prefix}
Mismatches between the semantics of intransitive verbs and their \gl{a}- or \gl{p}-oriented inflectional morphology are common, exemplified with modern \kalina data in \exref[kar1]{kar2}.

\pex<kar1> \kalina
\a<kar-60>
\begingl
\gla mi-kupi-ja//
\glb \gl{2}>\gl{3}-bathe-\gl{prs}//
\glft \qu{You bathe him/her.} \parencite[][160]{hoff1968carib}//
\endgl
\a<kar-62>
\begingl
\gla a-kupi-ja//
\glb \gl{3}>\gl{2}-bathe-\gl{prs}//
\glft \qu{S/he bathes you.} \parencite[][63]{yamada2011evidentiality}//
\endgl
\xe
%
In \exref{kar1}, the choice between the second person \gl{a}- and \gl{p}-oriented markers \obj{mi-} and \obj{a-} depends on the scenario:
The transitive verb \obj{kupi} \qu{to bathe} takes \obj{mi-} in \gl{2}>\gl{3} scenarios \exref{kar1.kar-60}, but \obj{a-} in \gl{3}>\gl{2} scenarios \exref{kar1.kar-62}.
The intransitive verbs in \exref{kar2} show the same person markers, but there is no choice what marker a specific verb uses.

\pex<kar2> \kalina
\a<kar-59>
\begingl
\gla sipi tɨnka-rɨ m-ekema-non hen//
\glb net pull-\gl{nmlz} \gl{2}-be.afraid-\gl{prs}.\gl{uncert} eh?//
\glft \qu{You're afraid to pull up the net, aren't you? } \parencite[][253]{courtz2008carib}//
\endgl
\a<kar-61>
\begingl
\glpreamble aya:woiya //
\gla aj-awomɨ-ja//
\glb \gl{2}-get.up-\gl{prs}//
\glft \qu{You are getting up.} \parencite[][167]{hoff1968carib}//
\endgl
\xe
%
Rather, \obj{ekema} \qu{to be afraid} takes an \gl{a}-oriented marker, since it is an \gl{s_a_} verb \exref{kar2.kar-59}, while the \gl{s_p_} verb \obj{awomɨ} \qu{to get up} takes a \gl{p}-oriented marker \exref{kar2.kar-61}.
It seems that in both cases, the prefix does not contribute to the semantics of the predicate, since there are clear mismatches:
\qu{to be afraid} with an \dbqu{agentive} marker can hardly be considered a volitional act, while  \qu{to get up} with a \dbqu{patientive} marker must be considered volitional.
\textcite{meira2000split} takes a sizable corpus of intransitive verbs from \trio, \kalina, \apalai, and \wayana, and categorizes them by applying different criteria commonly encountered in split-\gl{s} systems.
He shows that neither (non\-)activities, % \parencite[210]{meira2000split}, 
(non-)agency, % \citeyearpar[212]{meira2000split}, 
(in-)animacy, % \citeyearpar[213]{meira2000split},
nor Aktionsart % \citeyearpar[215]{meira2000split} 
satisfactorily predict the class membership of intransitive verbs.

Rather, the reason for a verb to take the \gl{a}- or \gl{p}-oriented prefix is (at least diachronically) a morphological one.
\textcite[217--221]{meira2000split} demonstrates that those intransitive verbs which (etymologically) have a detransitivizing prefix are treated as \gl{s_a_} verbs, while essentially all others are \gl{s_p_} verbs:
\begin{quotebox}{\parencite[201]{meira2000split}}
	Almost all verbs in the \gl{s_a_} class are detransitivized forms of transitive verbs, either synchronically (with still exisiting transitive sources) or diachronically (with reconstructible but no longer existing transitive sources)
\end{quotebox}
\textcite[221--223]{meira2000split} also argues that the detransitivizing prefixes are indeed deriving \gl{s_a_} verbs, rather than being inflectional in nature:
\begin{inlinelist}
	\item there are a few underived \gl{s_a_} verbs, with no detransitivizing prefix
	\item \gl{s_a_} verbs can develop irregular semantics compared to their transitive counterparts
	\item it is unpredictable whether the \gl{a} or \gl{p} argument of the underlying transitive verb becomes the \gl{s} of the derived \gl{s_a_} verb
	\item some originally derived \gl{s_a_} verbs have lost their transitive counterparts
	\item \dbqu{basic} concepts are expressed as derivations of more complex concepts, like \qu{to dance (\gl{s_a_})} from \qu{to dance with (\gl{tr})}
\end{inlinelist}.
He also notes that this leads to an inflectional split not based in meaning, but rather morphology:

\begin{quotebox}{\parencite[226]{meira2000split}}
	Apparently, the morphological behavior of the \gl{s_a_} verb class is an accidental consequence of the fact that detransitivization, as far back as we can reconstruct, entails all the morphology described […] as typical of \gl{s_a_} verbs. The alignment of person-marking prefixes appears not to be driven by any semantic forces in the language; it is as though they were being dragged by the evolution of the reflexive marker.
\end{quotebox}

As for the form of this marker, \textcite[505--512]{meira2010origin} reconstruct two distinct  prefixes for \PC: reciprocal \rc{əte-} and reflexive \rc{e-}, although they have since merged into a single morpheme, apparently in all languages.
Modern reflexes of \detrz show a range of meanings, which can all be characterized as \dbqu{detransitive}; this range is illustrated with \trio examples in \exref{triodetrz}.

\ex<triodetrz> \trio \parencites[218--219]{meira2000split}[128, 256]{triomeira1999}\\
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}llll@{}}

\end{tabular}
\xe
%
The morphological variation featured in \qu{to abandon each other} and \qu{to wash self} is due to the mentioned collapse between the two \PC prefixes:
\obj{e-} is a reflex of the reflexive prefix \rc{e-}, while the form \obj{əi-} originates in reciprocal \rc{əte-}.
However, both can occur with either meaning -- at least for these two verbs.
%As mentioned, there are a few \gl{s_a_} verbs that are not derived from transitive verbs, and do not have a reflex of \detrz, either.
%\textcite[221]{meira2000split} characterizes these as very old and exceptional, and counts between 5 and 7 verbs, depending on the language.
%\textcite{gildea2007greenberg} identify 7 such underived \gl{s_a_} verbs as reconstructible to \PC, shown in \cref{tab:underived2007}.
%Many of these verbs will be discussed in \cref{sec:verbs}.

%\input{floats/underived2007.tex}


\subsubsection{Summary and outlook}
We identified \gl{s_a_} verbs that irregularly inflect for first person in 9 Cariban languages.
These irregular forms are actually conservative, unaffected by person marker extensions spread via lexical diffusion.
Such conservative forms are only found among the first person forms of  (etymological) \gl{s_a_} verbs.
Our primary goal is to establish what verbs remained unaffected by the individual extensions and to search for factors explaining the patterns, proceeding as follows:
The topic of \cref{sec:extensions} are the six incomplete innovations, the innovative markers they introduced, and the verbs they left untouched.
Since these verbs show considerable etymological overlap between languages, they are reconstructed and discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:verbs}.
Finally, we search for factors motivating the resistance of these verbs, discuss the findings and put them in a general context of language change and morphology in \cref{sec:discussion}.
