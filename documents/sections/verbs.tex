\subsection{Conservative verbs in comparison}
\label{sec:verbs}
In \cref{sec:extensions}, six incomplete extensions of personal prefixes into \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} territory were presented, and the verbs resistant to these innovations were identified.
The set of unaffected verbs is rather small in most cases, and (proto-)languages show a considerable degree of overlap in what verbs are unaffected.
Therefore, this section investigates these verbs from a comparative perspective.
\cref{sec:be} treats both roots of the copula \rc{eti}/\obj{a[p]} \qu{to be}, \cref{sec:say} \rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say}, \cref{sec:go} \rc{ɨtə[mə]} \qu{to go}, and \cref{sec:come} \rc{(ət)jəpɨ} \qu{to come}.
\cref{sec:godown} takes a look at \rc{ɨpɨtə} \qu{to go down}, which is resistant in \PTir and \PPek, and  \cref{sec:bathe} investigates \rc{e-pɨ} \qu{to bathe}, of which the \PPek reflex \rc{ipɨ} resisted the extension of \rc{k-}.
The \obj{e}-initial verbs not affected by the extension of \obj{k-} in \akuriyo \pcref{sec:akuriyo} will not be discussed here, as they are a large and phonologically coherent group.

\subsubsection{\rc{eti} and \rc{a[p]} \qu{to be}}
\label{sec:be}
For a comprehensive comparative overview of these two roots, readers are refferd to \textcite[375--382]{gildea2018reconstructing}; they will not be discussed in detail here.
\rc{a[p]} is the original copula and can be reconstructed as already having various irregularities in \PC.
\rc{eti}, the other root, is reconstructed by \textcites{meira2009property}{gildea2018reconstructing} as originally meaning \qu{to dwell, live}, but serving as a copula already in \PC.\footnote{Such a stative, locative source is also suggested by the existence of \obj{it͡ʃi} \qu{to lie down} in \arara \parencite[196]{alves2017arara}.}
Various modern languages use reflexes of these two roots in a suppletive manner, conditioned by person and\slash{}or \gl{tam} value.
Both roots preserved \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} \rc{w-} in \PPek, \PWai, and \PTir (\crefrange{sec:pekodian}{sec:taranoan}).
\akuriyo \obj{a} was not affected by the extension of \obj{k-} \pcref{sec:akuriyo}, while \obj{eʔi} is not attested in a first-person form. 
\carijo innovated \obj{j-}, but only in the reflex of \rc{eti} \exref{mivida-12}; the \obj{a} root preserves \obj{w-} \pcref{sec:carijo}.
\yukpa introduced \obj{j-} to the reflexes of both \rc{a[p]} and \rc{eti}, which are preserved as encliticized auxiliaries in certain constructions \exref{yukcop}.

\subsubsection{\rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say}}
\label{sec:say}
Most reflexes of this verb are simply \obj{ka}, but a fleeting syllable \rc{ti} is reconstructed by \textcite{gildea2007greenberg}, best visible in the imperative forms of some languages \exref{kati}.

This verb was not affected by any of the extensions found in \PPek, \PWai, \PTir, \akuriyo, or \carijo (\crefrange{sec:pekodian}{sec:carijo}).
The first person form of its \yukpa reflex \obj{ka} is unattested.

As mentioned in \cref{sec:waiwaian}, \textcite{hixkaryanaderby1985} analyzes this verb as transitive in \hixka.
This analytical choice is not only motivated by a desire to avoid an idiosyncratic intransitive first person prefix \obj{ɨ-} instead of regular \obj{kɨ-}.
\hixka \obj{ka} also shows the complementary distribution of third person  \obj{n-} and preceding objects typical of transitive verbs in Cariban \parencite[60--81]{gildea1998}.
Due to the semantics of \qu{to say}, these objects are either ideophones or direct speech \exref{hixsay}.

\glft \qu{“That one there” they said.} \parencite[][14]{derbyshire1965textos}//
\endgl
\xe
In \exref{hixsay.hix-119}, the prefix \obj{n-} occurs because there is no preceding object (\qu{he said it like this}).
In \exref{hixsay.ordpl-35}, it does not occur, because \qu{they said} is preceded by direct speech.
Looking beyond \hixka, at least the \trio cognate shows the same pattern, albeit inconsistently so \parencite[267]{triocarlin2004}.

Derivational suffixes also point to \rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say} being transitive:
\trio \obj{ka} is characterized as the only intransitive verb being able to take the causative suffix \obj{-po} and the agentive nominalizer \obj{-ne} \parencite[263, 169]{triomeira1999}.
The exceptionality of \obj{ka} \qu{to say} taking \obj{-po} \qu{\gl{caus}.\gl{tr}} has also been noted for \kalina \parencite[82]{courtz2008carib} and \wayana \parencite[258]{wayanatavares2005}.
The agent nominalizer \rc{-ne} gave rise to the \panare gnomic verbal suffix \obj{-ɲe} on transitive verbs \parencite[184--185]{gildea1998}.
The occurrence of \obj{-ɲe} on \obj{ka} likely led \textcite[214]{panarepayne2013} to categorize it as transitive, contrasting with the intransitive analysis by \textcite[102]{mattei1994diccionario}.
Finally, reflexes of the causativizer \rc{-metipo}, usually restricted to transitive verbs \parencite{gildea2015valency}, are found with \obj{ka} in \apalai \parencite[51]{koehn1986apalai} and \waiwai \parencite[52]{waiwaihawkins1998}.

The categorization of \qu{to say} as an intransitive verb is supported primarily by its person prefixes.
\kalina offers a minimal pair between transitive \obj{ka} \qu{to remove} and intransitive \obj{ka} \qu{to say}, \obj{sikai} \qu{I took it away} vs \obj{wɨkai} \qu{I said} \parencite[288, 45]{courtz2008carib}.
Similarly, \qu{to say} has a reflex of \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} \rc{w-} in Pekodian languages \pcref{sec:pekodian}, rather than \gl{1}>\gl{3} \obj{s-} (\bakairi) or \rc{ini-} (\PXin).
Additionally, languages which differentiate direct prefixes from \gl{s_a_} prefixes by the presence of \obj{i} \parencite[495]{meira2010origin} show \obj{ɨ} instead of \obj{i} for this verb, see \exref{sayintr.aku-154} as well as \textcites[294]{triomeira1999}[195]{wayanatavares2005}[288]{ikpengpacheco2001}[150]{alves2017arara}[168]{hoff1968carib} for the verb's inflection in such languages.
Finally, the \gl{s_a_} class marker \obj{w-} occurs on nominalizations in \kalina \exref{sayintr.kar-84}, and it is probably reflected as vowel length in the \trio \parencite[333]{triomeira1999} and \wayana \parencite[196]{wayanatavares2005} participles.

\endgl
\xe

In summary, this verb can be reconstructed as being intransitive based on its prefixes, but transitive based on some suffixes.
\hixka has lost the main intransitive criteria, making its reflex look more like a transitive verb.
It is not attested as being affected by any of the person marker extensions  in \cref{sec:extensions}.

\subsubsection{\rc{ɨtə[mə]} \qu{to go}}
\label{sec:go}
This verb is reconstructed by \textcite{gildea2007greenberg} as \rc{tə[mə]}, like \rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say} with a fleeting second syllable.
It is true that many reflexes are clearly \obj{t}-initial, for example \hixka \obj{ntoje} \qu{he went} \parencite[27]{hixkaryanaderby1985}, \trio \obj{təkə} \qu{go!} \parencite[246]{triomeira1999}, or \wayana \obj{kuptəm} \qu{we went} \parencite[195]{wayanatavares2005}.
However, once one considers all forms of the various reflexes of this verb \pcref{tab:go}, an initial vowel \rc{ɨ} must clearly be reconstructed -- in contrast to unambiguously C-initial \rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say}.%
\footnote{As indicated by the brackets in \cref{tab:go}, there are many languages where the initial vowel is only present in some forms.
Also, the prefix-verb boundary in many inflected forms like e.g.\ \trio \obj{wɨtənne} or \arara \obj{wɨdolɨ} \qu{I went} \parencites[43]{triomeira1999}[153]{alves2017arara} is ambiguous, since an epenthetic \obj{ɨ} breaks up potential CC clusters.
Still, when one considers unambiguous forms, the contrast with \rc{ka[ti]} becomes very clear.}
This verb was not affected by the any of the extensions discussed in \cref{sec:extensions}.

%The \ikpeng form \obj{aran} is compatible with our reconstruction \rc{ɨtən} when considering that \ikpeng \obj{a} is an attested outcome of \rc{ə}: \begin{inlinelist}

%\end{inlinelist}.
%This attested change of \rc{ə} to \obj{a} need only be preceded by a assimilatory lowering of initial \rc{ɨ} to \rc{ə}, to yield the form \obj{aran} from \rc{ɨtən}.

\subsubsection{\rc{(ət-)jəpɨ} \qu{to come}}
\label{sec:come}

\input{floats/come}

This verb is reconstructed as \rc{ətepɨ} by \textcite[30]{gildea2007greenberg}, but an inspection of all attested reflexes \pcref{tab:come} suggests a somewhat more complex story.
Crucially, the majority do not reflect the \rc{ət} part of their reconstruction, and many forms are ostensibly reflexes of \rc{əpɨ}, \rc{jepɨ}, or \rc{jəpɨ}, rather than \rc{epɨ}.
A unifying account of all these forms is made possible by reconstructing a \PC verb of the form \rc{(ət-)jəpɨ}, morphologically segmentable into a detransitivizing prefix and a root \rc{jəpɨ}.

Evidence for the originally \rc{j}-initial nature of the root is found only in the Pemongan languages and \kaxui, although the coexistence of the forms \obj{oohɨ} and \obj{johɨ} in \kaxui raises the question of whether the \obj{j} in the latter form is actually part of the root.
\obj{johɨ} only occurs with third person in the Progressive \exref{kaxprog.kax-82}, and one might analyze \obj{j(-)} as a reflex of \rc{i-w-} \qu{\gl{3}-\gl{s_a_}-}, since the \gl{s_a_} class marker \rc{w-} is present with other person values \exref{kaxprog.kax-54}.
However, while C-initial verbs do show a clear reflex of third person \rc{i-} \exref{kaxprog.kax-77}, regular V-initial \gl{s_a_} verbs do not show \obj{j-}, but Ø \exref{kaxprog.kax-83}.
Thus, the best explanation for this \obj{j} is that is indeed part of the root, rather than an outcome of \rc{i-w-}, which in turn permits to confidently reconstruct \rc{j} back to \PC.

%
Most of the morphologically complex forms corresponding to \posscite{gildea2007greenberg} \rc{ətepɨ} do not show evidence for the segment \rc{j}, but the \obj{i} in the \akawaio form \obj{əsipɨ} is very likely a reflex of the sequence \rc{jə}.
This analysis is supported by the reflex \obj{ipɨ} from bare \rc{jəpɨ} in very closely related \macushi.

Turning to the many forms seemingly reflecting \rc{əpɨ} and \rc{epɨ} rather than \obj{jəpɨ}, it becomes evident are distributed widely in the family, sometimes even co-occurring in the same language.
A unifying account of these forms requires the root \rc{jəpɨ} to undergo two major sound changes: \begin{inlinelist}
 \item \rc{j}-loss
 \item \rc{ə}-umlaut after \rc{j}
 \end{inlinelist}.
While both sound changes are found in other contexts throughout the family \parencite{meira2010origin}, they appear to have applied irregularly to this verb, and not always in the same order.
For example, the \kalina form \obj{opɨ} can only be explained if \rc{j} was lost before the umlaut of \rc{ə} to \rc{e}, which would have been triggered by \rc{j}.
On the other hand, forms like \maqui \obj{ehə} must be the result of \phonl{\rc{ə}}{\rc{e}}{\rc{j}}, with subsequent loss of \rc{j}.
The \akuriyo form \obj{eepɨ} looks like a reflex thereof as well, but the length is unexpected, and is analyzed by \textcite[]{meira1998proto} as a coalescence of \rc{e} and \rc{əe}.

%Other languages -- across the family -- have forms reflecting the same root without the initial consonant, i.e.\ \rc{əpɨ}: \kalina, \panare, \yawarana, and \uxc.\footnote{\obj{e} is the regular outcome of \rc{ə} in \uxc; \rc{e} became \obj{i} \parencite[176]{meira2005southern}.}
%Also found across the family are forms reflecting \rc{epɨ}, in \kaxui, \arara, \trio, \carijo, \maqui, and \mapoyo.

While a root \rc{jəpɨ}, the two sound changes, and the optional addition of \rc{ət-} do account for the majority of the forms in \cref{tab:come},\footnote{
	Apart from aforementioned \akuriyo \obj{eepɨ}, another diachronically irregular form is \apalai \obj{oepɨ}, where one would expect \rc{ət-epɨ} to yield \obj{os-epɨ} \parencite[506]{meira2010origin}.
	Similarly, while \obj{oepɨ} would be a regular outcome of a hypothetical \rc{ə-jəpɨ}, the \envr{}{C} allomorph of the detransitivizer is \obj{e-} in \apalai.
	One possibility is that the form is due to borrowing from \trio, which has lost intervocalic \rc{t} to create \obj{əepɨ}.
	Alternatively, \apalai \obj{oepɨ} could be a fossilized loan from \wayana, which has replaced its reflex of \rc{ətjəpɨ}, but where intervocalic \rc{t} was also regularly lost \parencite[63]{wayanatavares2005}.}
the distribution within the family is rather chaotic.
In addition to the seemingly unordered distribution of \rc{əpɨ} and \rc{epɨ}, forms with and without \rc{ət-} can be found within the same language, usually conditioned by different prefixes.
This was briefly discussed in \cref{sec:pekodian} for \arara (and \PPek) and in \cref{sec:taranoan} for \trio (and \PTar).
To illustrate, the \trio \setone paradigm shows a reflex of \rc{ətepɨ} (< \rc{ətjəpɨ}) for first, but of \rc{epɨ} (< \rc{jəpɨ}) for the other persons \exref{tricome}.%
\footnote{While the \gl{1+2} form is a regular outcome of \rc{kɨt-epɨ}, the second person form is mysterious \parencite[115]{meira1998proto}.}
It should be noted that forms with and without \rc{ət-} in different languages are not triggered by the same person values.


\ex<tricome> \trio \parencite[294]{triomeira1999}\\
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}ll@{}}

	\gl{3} &  \obj{n-epɨ} \\
\end{tabular}
\xe

The interpretation of the \rc{ət} part as a detransitivizer is justifiable due to its form and its paradigmatically conditioned occurrence in some languages.
Although the combination of a detransitivizer and an intransitive verb seems semantically illogical, some historical \gl{s_p_} verbs are attested as adding the detransitivizer to become \gl{s_a_} verbs.
For example, the \PC \gl{s_p_} verb \rc{wɨnɨkɨ} \qu{to sleep} becomes \trio \obj{əənɨkɨ} \parencite[252]{triomeira1999} and \kalina \obj{əʔnɨkɨ} \parencite[429]{courtz2008carib}, both \gl{s_a_}.
Also, \waiwai \qu{go to sleep} can be \obj{wɨnɨk} \parencite[30]{waiwaihawkins1998} or \obj{et-wɨnɨk} \parencite[204]{hawkins1953waiwai}.
The parallels to \qu{to sleep} end here, since bare \rc{jəpɨ} \qu{to come} apparently already was an \gl{s_a_} verb, as evidenced the class membership of its reflexes in \kaxui, \kalina, \arara, \trio, and \panare \exref{pan-128}.

\ex<pan-128>\panare \parencite[][65]{panarepayne2013}\\

\glft \qu{Do you think it is gonna rain?}//
\endgl
\xe

Summing up, this verb is highly irregular, both from a synchronic and diachronic perspective.
The scenario suggested here involves reflexes of the detransitivizer \rc{ət(e)-} being optionally added to an \gl{s_a_} verb root \rc{jəpɨ}, which further underwent umlaut and loss of \rc{j}, but in no systematic manner, resulting in the chaotic picture in \cref{tab:come}.
As discussed in \cref{sec:pekodian}, innovative \rc{k-} was introduced on the \ikpeng and \bakairi reflexes of \rc{ətjəpɨ}, but not on the \arara reflex of \rc{jəpɨ}.
Reflexes of \rc{ətjəpɨ} (\trio) and of \rc{ətjəpɨ}/\rc{jəpɨ} (\akuriyo) resisted the introduction of \PTir \rc{t-}.
\carijo \obj{ehɨ} shows innovative \obj{j-}, rather than conservative \obj{w-} \exref{car-18}.
It is unknown whether there is a \yukpa reflex of this verb, and it was fully replaced in \PWai by \rc{omokɨ} \qu{to come} and was thus not a potential target of innovative \rc{k-}.

\subsubsection{\rc{ɨpɨtə} \qu{to go down}}
\label{sec:godown}
Reflexes of this verb were not affected by the extensions of \rc{k-} in \PPek \pcref{sec:pekodian} and \obj{k-} in \akuriyo \pcref{sec:akuriyo}.
The resistance against the former extension was subsequently overcome in \bakairi; its fate in \ikpeng is unknown.
When \akuriyo extended \obj{k-}, the verb already had an irregularly inflected first person form with \obj{p-}, inherited from \PTir.
At first sight, it may seem that it was also affected by the two independent extensions of \obj{j-} in \carijo \exref{gowhere.car-32} and \yukpa \exref{gowhere.yuk-14}.

However, a broader comparative perspective reveals a much more complicated story.
\cref{tab:godown} shows all attested reflexes of \rc{ɨpɨtə}, including verb class membership where applicable; parenthesized forms indicate uncertainty about cognacy status.%
\footnote{The reconstruction of \PPek \rc{ɨptə} in \cref{tab:godown} treats the suffixed elements found in the daughter languages as non-cognate.
\textcite{meira2005southern} make no mention of a regular correspondence between \bakairi \obj{gɨ} and \ikpeng \obj{ŋ}, and at least the addition of a final \obj{ŋ} in \PXin is attested elsewhere:
		\begin{inlinelist}

		\end{inlinelist} \parencites[8]{gildea2007greenberg}[56, 144, 57]{alves2017arara}[25, 270]{ikpengpacheco2001}.}
It turns out that while the form \rc{ɨpɨtə} can be reconstructed to \PC, different (proto-)languages do not agree about the class of this verb.
Its reflexes in languages that preserve the split-\gl{s} system are distributed fairly evenly between \gl{s_a_} and \gl{s_p_}.

\input{floats/godown}

In one language, \wayana, the verb shows traits of both classes, necessitating an analysis as a \dbqu{mixed} verb in a synchronic description of \wayana.
It takes the first and second person \gl{s_p_} markers \obj{j-} and \obj{əw-} \parencite[200]{wayanatavares2005}, but the \gl{1+2}\gl{s_a_} marker \obj{kut-} \parencite[206]{wayanatavares2005}.
It also shows the \gl{s_a_} class marker \obj{w-} in nominalizations \exref{waygodown.way-73}, but behaves like an \gl{s_p_} verb in taking a second person prefix in imperatives \exref{waygodown.way-71}.

Its causativized form is \obj{ɨptə-ka} \parencite[255]{wayanatavares2005}; the restriction of \rc{-ka} to \gl{s_p_} verbs in \PC \parencite{gildea2019overview} points to \gl{s_p_} membership.
These patterns are suggestive of a scenario in which the verb was a regular member of the \gl{s_p_} class in pre-\wayana, but partially switched to the \gl{s_a_} class, reflected only in its \gl{1+2} prefix and the \gl{s_a_} class marker.
This in turn implies that reflexes of this verb with \gl{s_a_} membership in other languages fully switched from \gl{s_p_} in their inflectional patterns.

\wayana-external comparative evidence supports this hypothesis:
The \arara causativized form is \obj{eniptoŋ} \parencite[66]{alves2017arara}, and \kalina has a cognate form \obj{enɨʔto} \parencite[263]{courtz2008carib}; \obj{onɨʔto} \qu{to go down} in \cref{tab:godown} is a detransitivized form thereof, lit.\ \qu{to get oneself down}.
Both causativized forms contain a reflex of the transitivizer \rc{en-}, which was usually found with \gl{s_p_} verbs \parencite{gildea2019overview}.
Besides the irregular first person \obj{p-}, \trio \obj{ɨhtə} shows other irregularities, in particular in its causativized forms that also feature a reflex of \rc{en-} \parencite[263]{triomeira1999}.
Thus, it appears that this verb was originally \gl{s_p_}, but then switched its class in four and a half languages of the family, for so far unknown reasons.

These circumstances make it impossible to answer the question of whether \qu{to go down} was affected by the extensions in \PWai, \PTir, \carijo, and \yukpa.
For \PTir, one cannot establish a relative chronology of the verb class switch, the introduction of the idiosyncratic marker \rc{p-}, and the extension of \rc{t-}.
For \PWai, not only the first person form of the verb is unknown, but even its class membership.
Similarly, for \carijo and \yukpa one cannot say whether the verb potentially switched class before the breakdown of the entire split-\gl{s} system.
While there is no language-internal evidence for such a switch, it is clear that \qu{to go down} does have an inclination to switch classes; in the case of \carijo, that could have already happened at the \PTar stage.
In all four cases, it is possible that the verb had \gl{s_a_} status at the time of the extension, resisting it and preserving the old prefix, but it is also possible that it was not even a potential target due to its \gl{s_p_} status at the time.

On the other hand, the class switch happened before the split-up of \trio and \akuriyo, and therefore this verb resisted the extension of \akuriyo \obj{k-} as an \gl{s_a_} verb.
Likewise, it is very likely that the class switch took place before the extension of \PPek \rc{k-}.
Otherwise, the newly-turned-\gl{s_a_} verb would have taken on conservative and lexically heavily restricted \rc{w-}, either in \PPek, \PXin, or \arara.

\subsubsection{\rc{e-pɨ} \qu{to bathe}}
\label{sec:bathe}
This verb resisted the extensions of \PPek \rc{k-} \pcref{sec:pekodian} and, trivially, \akuriyo \obj{k-} \pcref{sec:akuriyo}.
It took on new \gl{1}\gl{s_a_} prefixes in \PTir \parentext{\trio \obj{s-epɨ-}, \akuriyo \obj{t͡ʃe+pɨ-} \parencites[292]{triomeira1999}[87]{gildea1994akuriyo}} and \PWai \parentext{\hixka \obj{k-ewehɨ-}, \waiwai \obj{k-ejeɸu-} \parencites[195]{hixkaryanaderby1985}[166]{waiwaihawkins1998}}.
The first person form of its \carijo reflex \obj{ehɨ} \parencites[72]{koch1908hiana} is unknown; an unattested \yukpa cognate may exist.

Verbs for intransitive \qu{to bathe} are usually typical \gl{s_a_} verbs in Cariban languages, derived with a detransitivizer from a transitive root.
These roots are reflexes of \rc{pɨ}, or \rc{kupi} in some Venezuelan languages \pcref{tab:bathe}.
As was shown in \cref{sec:pekodian}, \PPek can be reconstructed as having the pair \rc{ipɨ} (\gl{intr}) / \rc{ɨp(ɨ)} (\gl{tr}).
Thus, while \PPek \qu{to bathe (\gl{tr})} has perfectly regular cognates in other languages of the family, intransitive \qu{to bathe} is divergent in this branch, changing \rc{e-} to \rc{i}.
This is an irregular development, since there are no attested reflexes of the detransitivizer in Pekodian that would go back to \PPek \rc{i-} \parencite[506]{meira2010origin}; its cause is unknown.
However, it should be noted that other languages also show unexpected developments in this verb, considering the glide insertions in Waiwaian or the distribution of \rc{pɨ} and \rc{kupi} in Venezuelan languages.
