\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In \cref{sec:verbs}, we reconstructed the verbs which were untouched by the incomplete person marker extensions discussed in \cref{sec:extensions}.
\cref{tab:overview} gives an overview of what verbs were affected by which extensions, except for \obj{e}-initial \akuriyo verbs unaffected by the extension of \obj{k-}, as they are a large and predictable group.
In a few cases we do not know the first person form (?), in others we have reason to believe that the verb does not occur at all or at least not inflected for first person (–), and in the case of \qu{to go down} we often do not know when the switch to \gl{s_a_} happened, if at all (\textsc{n/a}).
Every \checkmark stands for a verb affected by an extension, while × represents conservatively inflected verbs.
This overview makes clear just how pervasive the tendency for these verbs to resist innovative markers is.

\input{floats/overview}

It is astonishing that the same 1-7 verbs retain their old first person marker in 6 distinct developments, while a plethora of regular \gl{s}\textsubscript{(\gl{a})} verbs take on innovative markers.
This suggest that there is some strong motivation for these verbs to not be affected by innovative markers.
The question arises what properties unite these verbs and make them so conservative across different Cariban languages.
We will discuss possible answers to this question in \cref{sec:motivations}, using \posscite{bybee1985morphology} network model of morphology.

\subsection{Motivations for conservativeness}
\label{sec:motivations}
The most well-known contribution regarding conservativeness, innovativeness, and (ir-){}re\-gu\-la\-ri\-ty in the lexicon is \textcite{bybee1985morphology} with her network model of morphology, which seems well-suited for the data at hand.
It aims \dbqu{to account for cross-linguistic, diachronic and acquisition patterns in complex morphological systems} \parencite[428]{bybee1995regular}.
It does so by modeling shared morphological properties such as inflectional patterns as emerging from connections of differing strength between lexemes.
A classic example is a large group of connected \dbqu{strong} English verbs with \obj{strɪŋ}--\obj{strʌŋ} at the center and pairs like \obj{rɪŋ}--\obj{rʌŋ}, \obj{spɪn}--\obj{spʌn}, or \obj{stɪk}--\obj{stʌk} at its periphery.
This network is attracting new verbs in certain dialects, like \obj{sniːk}--\obj{snʌk} or \obj{brɪŋ}--\obj{brʌŋ} \parencite[129--130]{bybee1985morphology}.
These verbs are recruited based on the lexical connection they form with prototypical members of the group, and accordingly develop irregular or \dbqu{strong} past tense forms.

For the basis of these connections between lexemes, \textcite[118]{bybee1985morphology} suggests the criteria of semantic, phonological, and morphological similarity; the English strong verbs are an example for a phonologically motivated network.
Another important factor in the model is frequency, since more frequent words have a higher lexical strength \parencite[119]{bybee1985morphology}.
This higher lexical strength results in less influence from other lexemes, meaning that high-frequency items are more likely to resist innovations.
%todo CONTINUE HERE
Thus, from the diachronic perspective on Cariban we are taking here, the prediction is that a) semantically\slash{}phonologically\slash\hspace{0pt}morphologically similar verbs will be affected by person marker extensions, and b) high-frequency verbs will tend to resist them and thus remain archaic.

When considering the verbs that resisted any of the extensions investigated \pcref{tab:overview}, a salient morphological property emerges:
Most of the verbs lack a reflex of the detransitivizer \detrz, which normal \gl{s_a_} verbs do possess \pcref{sec:split}.
This was already noted by \textcite{meira1998proto} for the group of \PTar verbs taking irregular first person \rc{w-}:
\begin{quotebox}{\parencite[112]{meira1998proto}}
	This category includes a small number of stems, among which ‘to go’, ‘to come’, ‘to say’, [...]\footnote{The original list includes \qu{to go down} and \qu{to defecate}. While these verbs are indeed underived \gl{s_a_} verbs in \trio, no irregular first person \rc{w-} can be reconstructed. As their inclusion in the list was most likely an error, we have omitted them here.} and the copula. These are basically the verbs that are not synchronically or diachronically detransitivized, yet belong to the A conjugation.
\end{quotebox} % ‘to go down’, ‘to defecate’,
%How well this morphological property explains which patterns will be discussedss in \cref{sec:morphology}.
%
A further common property is phonological in nature, since regular \gl{s_a_} verbs all have reflexes of \detrz, they all begin with reflexes of \rc{ə} or \rc{e}.
%In some cases, the initial segment of the verb stem seems to have indeed been the crucial factor \pcref{sec:phonology}.
Finally, at least the first four verbs in \cref{tab:overview} are very likely the most frequent \gl{s_a_} verbs.
The correlation between the absence of a detransitivizer and frequency has e.g.\ been noted for \kalina by \textcite[75]{courtz2008carib}: \dbqu{It is difficult […] to imagine an intransitive or transitive origin for some of the most frequent middle verbs}.
%Such possible frequency effects are discussed in \cref{sec:frequency}.
%
There are no semantic patterns that would be obvious, which is not unsurprising given the lack of semantic patterns in the split-\gl{s} system overall \pcref{sec:split}.
This leaves us with three possibly relevant factors: phonology, morphology, and frequency.

To test these factors, we defined a test for each to see what fate it would predict for a given verb.
The morphological criterion was of course the presence or absence of a detransitivizer, which predicted affectedness or unaffectedness, respectively.
The phonological pattern uniting regular derived \gl{s_a_} verbs is \obj{e-} and \obj{ə}/\obj{o}-initialness, so we checked whether the initial segment of each verb stem fit that criterion.
To increase the accuracy of prediction, we then changed the criteria on the initial segment for some languages, based on the patterns we noticed, see below.
A major obstacle to investigating frequency effects was that we are not aware of frequency counts of individual lexemes for any Cariban language.
In absence of such data, we simply categorized the verbs based on the following assumptions:
\begin{inlinelist}
	\item \qu{to say}, \qu{to go}, and \qu{to be} are the most frequent \gl{s_a_} verbs
	\item \qu{to come}, \qu{to go down} and \qu{to bathe} are much less frequent
\end{inlinelist}.
The prediction was then that the four frequent verbs would retain their old marker, and the three infrequent ones would innovate, but it should be kept in mind that any statements about frequency effects are based on assumptions.

Finally, we compared the information about (un-)affectedness of verbs \pcref{tab:overview} with the predictions and established the proportion of verbs whose behavior was correctly predicted, by each factor, for each extension.
The results of that comparison are shown in \cref{tab:factors}.
As can be seen, there are quite a few combinations of factor and extension where 100\% of the behavior was correctly predicted.
However, it is important to understand that the proportions shown in that table only refer to the group of seven verbs in \cref{tab:overview}, i.e. those that are attested as resisting at least one extension.
For each extension, there are many run-of-the-mill \gl{s_a_} verbs which are regularly inflected.
The morphological and phonological criteria would in each case correctly predict 100\% of these regular verbs; if our assumptions about frequency were indeed accurate, so would this criterion.


\input{floats/factors}

%\subsubsection{Morphology: \PWai and \PPek}
%\label{sec:morphology}
The extent of the extensions in both \PWai and \PPek is fully predicted by the presence or absence of a detransitivizer.
In \PWai, only the four underived \gl{s_a_} verbs were not affected, while all other \gl{s_a_} verbs (with \detrz) have regular \rc{k-}.
The case for a morphologically conditioned lexical network is even stronger in \PPek, where all seven unaffected verbs have no detransitivizing prefix, contrasting with a plethora of derived \gl{s_a_} verbs with \rc{k-}.
Note that it is necessary for this analysis to assume that the idiosyncratic evolution of \rc{e-pɨ} \qu{to bathe (\gl{intr})} to \rc{ipɨ} effectively removed the transparent derivational prefix.
Not seen in \cref{tab:factors} are subsequent evolutions in the daughter languages:
First, we argued that both \ikpeng and \bakairi regularized the paradigm to use forms with detransitivizer for first person, which in both languages led to an introduction of \obj{k-}.%
\footnote{If one instead assumes that first person \rc{w-ebɨ-} and \rc{k-əd-ebɨ-} already co-existed in \PPek, the clear correlation remains.}
Second, the subsequent introduction of \obj{k-} to \ikpeng \obj{aran} \qu{to go} (< \rc{ɨtən}) potentially suggests a reanalysis of \obj{ar} as a detransitivizer.

%\subsubsection{Phonology: \akuriyo, \carijo, \yukpa}
%\label{sec:phonology}
Three extensions are fully predicted by phonological criteria, those in \akuriyo, \carijo, and \yukpa.
We have already discussed \akuriyo \obj{k-} \pcref{sec:akuriyo}, which only appears on \obj{ə}-initial verbs.
In \carijo, the extension of \obj{j-} affected \obj{e}- and \obj{ə}-initial verbs, including \obj{eh} \qu{to come} or \obj{et͡ʃi} \qu{to be}, which do not have a detransitivizing prefix.
Only \obj{ka} \qu{say}, \obj{təmə} \qu{go}, and \obj{a} \qu{be-1} did not take on \obj{j-}.
Similarly, the extension of \yukpa \obj{j-} can succinctly be characterized as affecting all vowel-initial verbs; the only verb attested as unaffected is C-initial \obj{to} \qu{to go}.
It may be worth noting that the three extensions which we do not reconstruct to a proto-language (i.e., which are more recent) seem to be phonologically conditioned.

%\subsubsection{Frequency: \PWai?}
%\label{sec:frequency}
There is one extension where our model of frequency correctly predicted 100\% of (un-)affected verbs, in \PWai.
The four unaffected \gl{s_a_} verbs are the ones we assume to be the most frequent.
Incidentally, they are also the only ones without a detransitivizer, so both factors predict the same outcome.
This brings us to the cases where not all outcomes were correctly predicted; in many cases, the proportion is still quite high.
For example, the morphological criterion accounts for the behavior of 5/6 verbs in the case of \PTir; the one divergent verb is \rc{əʔepɨ} \qu{to come}, where the synchronic presence of a detransitivizer is debatable.
Similarly, frequency correctly predicts the behavior of 4/5 verbs in the extension of \carijo \obj{j-}; the only incorrect one is \obj{et͡ʃi} \qu{to be}.
Or consider the \dbqu{most} resistant verb, which is not attested as having taken on a new first person marker in any language, \rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say}.
It is at the same time: \begin{inlinelist}
	\item one of the few \gl{s_a_} verbs without a reflex of \rc{ət(e)-}/\obj{e-}
	\item the only C-initial \gl{s_a_} verb in \PC
	\item highly frequent
\end{inlinelist}.
That is, one would expect it to resist morphological innovation based on all three factors: morphological makeup, phonological form, and frequency.
Thus, while \posscite{bybee1985morphology} model for the most part correctly predicts the patterns, it is not always clear which is the decisive conditioning factor, as they are strongly interrelated in Cariban \gl{s_a_} verbs.
%The extension of \PWai \rc{k-} perfectly fits this pattern; the four unaffected \gl{s_a_} verbs are the ones we assume to be the most frequent.



%
%The same kind of convergence is found for most other verbs consistently emerging as resistant across the family.
%They are more frequent than other \gl{s_a_} verbs, and diverge phonologically and morphologically from them.
%This results in an overall picture where the factors leading to irregular or archaic morphological patterns strongly overlap, to a degree where one cannot simply decide which factor ultimately contributed.


\subsection{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item why are the most irregular verbs all underived \gl{s_a_} verbs? \textbf{something} is there
	\item ultimately plays into the mystery of how the hell the split-\gl{s} system actually came into being
	\item not surprising that more frequent \gl{s_a_} verbs have no \rc{ət-}, but definitely surprising that \qu{say}, \qu{go}, and \qu{be} are \gl{s_a_} verbs in the first place!
\end{itemize}

%Also: \dbqu{lexical […] splits constitute important evidence about the structure of the lexicon.} \parencite[119]{bybee1985morphology}.
%This suggests that the unaffected verbs form their own distinct part of the lexicon.
%In the case of the ones without \detrz, this means that they are distinct from the \dbqu{regular} ones (open class) in the lexicon.
