\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In \cref{sec:verbs}, we reconstructed the verbs which were untouched by the incomplete person marker extensions discussed in \cref{sec:extensions}.
\cref{tab:overview} gives an overview of what verbs were affected by which extensions, except for \obj{e}-initial \akuriyo verbs unaffected by the extension of \obj{k-}, as they are a large and predictable group.
In a few cases we do not know the first person form (?), in others we have reason to believe that the verb does not occur at all or at least not inflected for first person (–), and in the case of \qu{to go down} we often do not know when the switch to \gl{s_a_} happened, if at all (\textsc{n/a}).
Every \checkmark stands for a verb affected by an extension, while × represents conservatively inflected verbs.
This overview makes clear just how pervasive the tendency for these verbs to resist innovative markers is.

%It is astonishing that the same 1-7 verbs retain their old first person marker in 6 distinct developments, while a plethora of regular \gl{s}\textsubscript{(\gl{a})} verbs take on innovative markers.
%This suggest that there is some strong motivation for these verbs to not be affected by innovative markers.
%The question arises what properties unite these verbs and make them so conservative across different Cariban languages.
%We will discuss possible answers to this question in \cref{sec:motivations}, using \posscite{bybee1985morphology} network model of morphology.
%
%\subsection{Reasons for conservativeness}
%\label{sec:motivations}
%Perhaps the most well-known contribution regarding conservativeness, innovativeness, and (ir-){}re\-gu\-la\-ri\-ty in the lexicon is \textcite{bybee1985morphology} with her network model of morphology, which seems well-suited for the data at hand.
%It aims \dbqu{to account for cross-linguistic, diachronic and acquisition patterns in complex morphological systems} \parencite[428]{bybee1995regular}.
%It does so by modeling shared morphological properties such as inflectional patterns as emerging from connections of differing strength between lexemes.
%A classic example is a large group of connected \dbqu{strong} English verbs with \obj{strɪŋ}--\obj{strʌŋ} at the center and pairs like \obj{rɪŋ}--\obj{rʌŋ}, \obj{spɪn}--\obj{spʌn}, or \obj{stɪk}--\obj{stʌk} at its periphery.
%This network is attracting new verbs in certain dialects, like \obj{sniːk}--\obj{snʌk} or \obj{brɪŋ}--\obj{brʌŋ} \parencite[129--130]{bybee1985morphology}.
%These verbs are recruited based on the lexical connection they form with prototypical members of the group, and accordingly develop irregular or \dbqu{strong} past tense forms.
%
%As possible bases of these connections between lexemes, \textcite[118]{bybee1985morphology} suggests the criteria of semantic, phonological, and morphological similarity; the English strong verbs are an example for a phonologically motivated network.
%Another important factor in the model is frequency, since more frequent words have a higher lexical strength \parencite[119]{bybee1985morphology}.
%This higher lexical strength dminishes the influence from other lexemes, meaning that high-frequency items are more likely to resist innovations.
%For our diachronic study of Cariban inflectional patterns, the model would predict that a) semantically\slash{}phonologically\slash\hspace{0pt}morphologically similar verbs will be affected by person marker extensions, and b) high-frequency verbs will tend to resist them and thus remain conservative.
%
%When considering the verbs in \cref{tab:overview} that resisted at least one extension, a salient morphological pattern emerges:
%Most of the verbs lack a reflex of the detransitivizer \detrz, which  \gl{s_a_} verbs usually have \pcref{sec:split}.
%This was already noted by \textcite{meira1998proto} for the group of \PTar verbs taking irregular first person \rc{w-}:
%\begin{quotebox}{\parencite[112]{meira1998proto}}
%	This category includes a small number of stems, among which ‘to go’, ‘to come’, ‘to say’, [...]\footnote{The original list includes \qu{to go down} and \qu{to defecate}. While these verbs are indeed underived \gl{s_a_} verbs in \trio, no irregular first person \rc{w-} can be reconstructed. As their inclusion in the list was most likely an error, we omit them here.} and the copula. These are basically the verbs that are not synchronically or diachronically detransitivized, yet belong to the A conjugation.
%\end{quotebox} % ‘to go down’, ‘to defecate’,
%%
%The absence of reflexes of \detrz also has a phonological consequence: usually, \gl{s_a_} verbs begin with reflexes of \rc{ə} or \rc{e}, as noted for \arara verbs with \obj{k-} by \textcite[153]{alves2017arara}: \dbqu{Observe que todos os 12 verbos indexados pelo morfema \obj{k-} [\gl{s_a_}] apresentam a raiz iniciada pela vogal /o/}.
%Also, at least the first four verbs in \cref{tab:overview} are very likely the most frequent \gl{s_a_} verbs, as noted for \kalina by \textcite[75]{courtz2008carib}: \dbqu{It is difficult […] to imagine an intransitive or transitive origin for some of the most frequent middle verbs}.
%%Such possible frequency effects are discussed in \cref{sec:frequency}.
%%
%There are no semantic patterns that would be obvious, which is not unsurprising given the lack of semantic patterns in the split-\gl{s} system overall \pcref{sec:split}.
%This leaves us with three potentially relevant factors: phonology, morphology, and frequency.
%
%To test how well each of these factors explains the extent of each extension, we determined whether innovative or conservative behavior would be predicted for each verb in \cref{tab:overview}.
%As a morphological criterion, we used the presence or absence of a detransitivizer, respectively predicting innovativeness or conservativeness.
%As a possible phonological criterion, we started with \obj{e-} and \obj{ə}/\obj{o}-initialness, based on the reflexes of \detrz.
%We then modified this criterion on a language-specific basis in order to increase prediction accuracy for each extension, see below.
%
%When it comes to investigating the expected conservative effects of verb frequency, a major obstacle is the lack of frequency counts for individual lexemes for any Cariban language.
%We are only aware of \posscite[75]{courtz2008carib} claim of \kalina underived \gl{s_a_} verbs being the most frequent ones, but it is supported neither by frequency counts nor a list of verbs -- although it seems likely that these underived \gl{s_a_} verbs refer to the two roots for \qu{to be}, \qu{to say}, \qu{to go}, and \qu{to come}.
%Given this dearth of data, we conducted a count of \gl{s_a_} verbs in two glossed texts from \textcite{koehns1994textos}.
%The (very preliminary) results in \cref{tab:apalaicounts} clearly show the first four verbs in \cref{tab:overview} as being much more frequent than other \gl{s_a_} verbs.
%It is not at all certain that this small \apalai sample is really representative of discourse patterns in the Cariban (proto-)languages under discussion, but given its agreement with \citeauthor{courtz2008carib}'s claim it seemed appropriate to categorize the verbs based as follows:
%\begin{inlinelist}
%	\item \qu{to say}, \qu{to go}, and \qu{to be} are the most frequent \gl{s_a_} verbs
%	\item \qu{to come}, \qu{to go down} and \qu{to bathe} are much less frequent
%\end{inlinelist}.
%The prediction was then that the four frequent verbs should retain their old marker, while the three infrequent ones should be affected by person marker extensions, but it should be kept in mind that the actual frequency distributions may well have been different when innovative markers spread.
%
%\input{floats/apalaicounts.tex}
%
%Next, we compared the information about (un-)affectedness of verbs \pcref{tab:overview} with the predictions and established the proportion of verbs whose behavior was correctly predicted, by each factor, for each extension.
%The results \pcref{tab:factors} show that there are quite a few combinations of factor and extension where 100\% of the behavior was correctly predicted.
%It is important to understand that these ratios only refer to the group of seven verbs in \cref{tab:overview}, i.e. those that are attested as resisting at least one extension.
%For each extension, there were also many run-of-the-mill \gl{s_a_} verbs, all taking on the new person marker, except for the \akuriyo \obj{e}-initial verbs.%
%\footnote{While there are a few \gl{s_a_} verbs not transparently derived from transitive verbs \parencites[252]{triomeira1999}[222]{meira2000split}[30]{gildea2007greenberg}, which are not featured in \cref{tab:overview}, these are mostly \rc{ə}-initial and were likely productively derived at some point.
%The verbs to which this does not apply, like \trio \obj{wa} \qu{to dance} \parencites[252]{triomeira1999}, are all instances of \gl{s_p_} verbs switching classes.
%Since none of them is attested as being an \gl{s_a_} verb at the time of a person marker extension, they are outside of the scope of our investigation.}
%Morphological and phonological criteria would always correctly predict these to behave innovatively; the same is true about frequency, if our assumptions are indeed accurate.
%All percentages would be considerably higher if all verbs were taken into account, but the available data simply does not allow such large-scale tests for Cariban languages.

%%\subsubsection{Morphology: \PWai and \PPek}
%%\label{sec:morphology}
%The extent of the extensions in both \PWai and \PPek is fully predicted by the presence or absence of a detransitivizer.
%In \PWai, only the four underived \gl{s_a_} verbs were not affected, while all other \gl{s_a_} verbs have regular \rc{k-}.
%The case for a morphologically conditioned lexical network is even stronger in \PPek, where all seven unaffected verbs have no detransitivizing prefix, contrasting with a plethora of derived \gl{s_a_} verbs with \rc{k-}.
%Note that it is necessary for this analysis to assume that the idiosyncratic evolution of \rc{e-pɨ} \qu{to bathe (\gl{intr})} to \rc{ipɨ}  made the verb morphologically opaque.
%Not shown in \cref{tab:factors} are subsequent evolutions in the daughter languages:
%First, we argued that both \ikpeng and \bakairi regularized the paradigm to use forms with detransitivizer for first person, which in both languages led to an introduction of \obj{k-}.%
%\footnote{If one instead assumes that first person \rc{w-ebɨ-} and \rc{k-əd-ebɨ-} already co-existed in \PPek, the clear correlation between \rc{k-} and the detransitivizer remains.}
%Second, the subsequent introduction of \obj{k-} to \ikpeng \obj{aran} \qu{to go} (< \rc{ɨtən}) potentially suggests a reanalysis of \obj{ar} as a detransitivizer.
%
%%\subsubsection{Phonology: \akuriyo, \carijo, \yukpa}
%%\label{sec:phonology}
%Three extensions are fully predicted by phonological criteria, those in \akuriyo, \carijo, and \yukpa.
%We have already discussed \akuriyo \obj{k-} \pcref{sec:akuriyo}, which only appears on \obj{ə}-initial verbs.
%In \carijo, the extension of \obj{j-} affected \obj{e}- and \obj{ə}-initial verbs, including \obj{eh} \qu{to come} or \obj{et͡ʃi} \qu{to be}, which do not have a detransitivizing prefix.
%Only \obj{ka} \qu{say}, \obj{təmə} \qu{go}, and \obj{a} \qu{be-1} did not take on \obj{j-}.
%Similarly, the extension of \yukpa \obj{j-} can succinctly be characterized as affecting all vowel-initial verbs; the only verb attested as unaffected is C-initial \obj{to} \qu{to go}.
%It may be worth noting that the three extensions which we do not reconstruct to a proto-language (i.e., which are more recent) are best explained by phonological conditioning factors.
%
%%\subsubsection{Frequency: \PWai?}
%%\label{sec:frequency}
%There is one extension where our primitive model of frequency correctly predicted 100\% of (un-){}affected verbs, in \PWai.
%The four unaffected \gl{s_a_} verbs are precisely the ones we assume to be the most frequent.
%Incidentally, they are also the only ones without a detransitivizer, so both factors predict the same outcome.
%
%This brings us to the cases where not all outcomes were correctly predicted; in many cases, the proportion is still quite high.
%For example, the morphological criterion accounts for the behavior of 5/6 verbs in the case of \PTir; the one divergent verb is \rc{əʔepɨ} \qu{to come}, where the synchronic presence of a detransitivizer is debatable.
%Similarly, frequency correctly predicts the behavior of 4/5 verbs in the extension of \carijo \obj{j-}; the only incorrect one is \obj{et͡ʃi} \qu{to be}.
%Or consider the \dbqu{most} resistant verb, which is not attested as having taken on a new first person marker in any language, \rc{ka[ti]} \qu{to say}.
%It is at the same time: \begin{inlinelist}
%	\item one of the few \gl{s_a_} verbs without a reflex of \rc{ət(e)-}/\obj{e-}
%	\item the only C-initial \gl{s_a_} verb in \PC
%	\item highly frequent
%\end{inlinelist}.
%That is, one would expect it to resist morphological innovation based on all three factors: morphological makeup, phonological form, and frequency.
%Thus, while \posscite{bybee1985morphology} model for the most part correctly predicts the patterns, it is not always clear which is the decisive conditioning factor, as they are strongly interrelated in Cariban \gl{s_a_} verbs.
%The extension of \PWai \rc{k-} perfectly fits this pattern; the four unaffected \gl{s_a_} verbs are the ones we assume to be the most frequent.



%
%The same kind of convergence is found for most other verbs consistently emerging as resistant across the family.
%They are more frequent than other \gl{s_a_} verbs, and diverge phonologically and morphologically from them.
%This results in an overall picture where the factors leading to irregular or archaic morphological patterns strongly overlap, to a degree where one cannot simply decide which factor ultimately contributed.


\subsection{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item why are the most irregular verbs all underived \gl{s_a_} verbs? \textbf{something} is there
	\item ultimately plays into the mystery of how the hell the split-\gl{s} system actually came into being
	\item not surprising that more frequent \gl{s_a_} verbs have no \rc{ət-}, but definitely surprising that \qu{say}, \qu{go}, and \qu{be} are \gl{s_a_} verbs in the first place!
\end{itemize}

%Also: \dbqu{lexical […] splits constitute important evidence about the structure of the lexicon.} \parencite[119]{bybee1985morphology}.
%This suggests that the unaffected verbs form their own distinct part of the lexicon.
%In the case of the ones without \detrz, this means that they are distinct from the \dbqu{regular} ones (open class) in the lexicon.
