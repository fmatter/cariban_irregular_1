Nine Cariban languages have a group of intransitive verbs irregularly inflected for first person.
The irregular first person markers are conservative, contrasting with innovative regular markers.
They are a result of person marker extensions not affecting some verbs, which happened independently in six (proto-)languages.
These six incomplete extensions left between one and seven conservatively inflected verbs, which show a large etymological overlap across (proto-)languages.
Bybee's network model of morphology was used to generate hypotheses about factors causing the distribution of conservative and innovative markers in each language.
Predictions of different possible factors were then tested against the data.
Because of patterns reconstructible to Proto-Cariban, the hypothesized factors largely overlap in their predictions, though phonology (combined with frequency) shows a strong overall performance.
