Nine Cariban languages have a group of intransitive verbs irregularly inflected for first person.
Irregular first person markers are conservative, a result of person marker extensions not affecting some verbs, in six distinct developments.
The six incomplete extensions left between one and seven conservatively inflected verbs, which show a great overlap across (proto-)languages.
Bybee's network model of morphology was used to generate predictions about the distribution of conservative and innovative markers in each language, which were tested against the data.
Due to patterns reconstructible to Proto-Cariban, the hypothesized factors largely overlap in their predictions, though phonology (and frequency) shows a strong overall performance.
